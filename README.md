# Provide Writing Feedback (The Stripped Down Version)

## Evaluate if required section topics were covered

* This requires that requirements for section topics are already clearly defined.

* Identifying what students have missed is a great place to start.

## Reverse outline the section

* https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents#highlighting
* This helps you identify the basic logic used ot organize the section.
* This also helps you evaluate how well each paragraph is structured.
* Internal paragraph structure seems to be a major place many students have problems.
* Order of paragraphs in a section is often also where students demonstrate disordered organization.
